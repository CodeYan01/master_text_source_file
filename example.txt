<Description>
This is a Python script that automates updating multiple text source files using
only one file.

Source names should be enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. <My Text Source>) on a line without any other characters.
As you can see, even if I put <My Text Source> in the contents, it will not be
detected as a source name. It is space-sensitive, so if your source has spaces at the start or end, be sure to include them.

If I put 3 blank lines before the next source, only 2 blank lines will be included.



<Additional>
It is also fine to not have blank lines before the next source name if you prefer.

Thank you!
